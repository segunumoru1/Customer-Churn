# Financial Inclusion in Africa
## Objective

The term financial inclusion means:  individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.

 ## Dataset description: 
The dataset contains demographic information and what financial services are used by approximately 33,600 individuals across East Africa. The ML model role is to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account.
